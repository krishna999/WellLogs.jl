## Introduction
This package is being designed among others to provide Petroleum Engineering tools in a modern programming language. This package is part of the project 7G which  proposes to make basic but powerful engineering software packages that cover the main topics of the Oil and Gas development phases which could be applied to any case study by suitable engineers.

There are five topics in which the project is going to be focused on:

-Geoscience
-Reservoir
-Production
-Economics
